# Module 1: My first Web page   1.2 The big three: HTML5, CSS and JavaScript   Vague but exciting!

## The Web: vague but exciting!

Twenty six years ago today, a proposal was sent internally at CERN outlying a universal linked information system. Dubbed 'Information Management: A proposal', pictured below, the proposal was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee and was sent to his boss Mike Sendall, who described it as 'vague but exciting'.

Tim Berners-Lee original proposal for the Web

Sir Tim Berners-Lee’s vision for universality enabled the development of a high-level network of content that allows any document to link to any other documents.

The World Wide Web was initially created to make it easier to share research papers. It is a system of interlinked ‘hypertext’ documents that are accessed via the Internet; in essence, an information space. While he did not invent hypertext systems, Berners-Lee proposed using them 'to link and access information of various kinds as a web of nodes in which the user can browse at will.'

His breakthrough was to link hypertext to the Internet and he used three technologies to do this:

HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of data communication for the Web.
HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the main mark-up language for creating Web pages and information that can be displayed on a Web browser.
Web addresses or a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) are used to reference a Web page.
In the following pages, we present HTML through what is usually called the big 3 (HTML5, CSS and JavaScript), the hypertext concept and the browser that is an application program that provides a way to look at and interact with all the information on the World Wide Web.

What is HTML5?

When people say 'HTML5', they usually mean a bit more than just the 5th version of the "HyperText Markup Language". Modern Web pages and Web applications are generally composed of at least three components, so what people often mean when they say 'HTML5' is the trio of languages: HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

The 'HTML' part contains all the content, organized into a logical structure.  This is the part that an author might be most concerned with: the words, chapter headings, figures, diagrams, etc. 

While there have been numerous versions of HTML since its inception, our focus in this course is the most recent version, HTML5.  HTML5 was developed to provide more powerful and flexible ways for developers to create dynamic Web pages.

CSS

CSS3 logo

The 'CSS' part (version 3 being current) is all about the presentation or style of the page; what it looks like without too much regard for the specific content. We'll be going into more detail on that later in this course, but for now, think of it as the way you might specify a "theme" in a word processing document, setting fonts, sizes, indentations and whatever else may apply to what it looks like.

 

JavaScript

Javascript logo

The 'JavaScript' part is about the actions a page can take such as interaction with the user, and customizing and changing the page according to any number of parameters.  This is what allows a Web page to be more than just a document, but potentially a Web application, with nearly unlimited possibilities.  We will not be doing much with JavaScript in this course, but you should know that it is an important leg of the stool for modern Web pages.

# Module 1: My first Web page   1.2 The big three: HTML5, CSS and JavaScript   Hypertext

# Hypertext

A fundamental key to the World Wide Web is the concept of "Hypertext".  Hypertext is built on the idea of linking information together, not unlike using footnotes, except much easier and more flexible. The idea was to "Mark Up" your document with links and define how to break it down into different segments (chapters, sections, paragraphs, tables, figures, etc.)

That's why, in 1989, Tim Berners-Lee began to create a definition of HTML: Hypertext Markup Language, to provide a simple, uniform way to incorporate Hyperlinks in a text document.

Illustration of Hypertext documents

He envisioned a technology that would facilitate thoroughly interconnected documents. He wanted authors to be able to connect an idea in one document to the source of the idea in another, or connect a statement with the data that backs up that statement. Traditionally this kind of thing was done with footnotes and bibliographies, which can be cumbersome. This information should be easily transferable from one place to another, so that in reading one document, it is easy to access everything related (linked) to it. Tim Berners-Lee imagined a "Web" of interconnected documents.

He used the metaphor of a Web to emphasize the importance of connections between documents. It was not just a long list of details, but rather a sea of information stretching out in all directions. This sea of information was navigated by a new tool called a "Browser".

# Module 1: My first Web page   1.2 The big three: HTML5, CSS and JavaScript   The browser

# The browser

A group of people considering browsers while looking at a laptop screen

The Internet existed long before the Web came to fruition, and lots of organizations were connected to it, including schools, companies and government organizations.  As things progressed through the 80's, the Internet was used for file transfers, newsgroups (a kind of open forum), email and other conveniences.

snapshot of a Mosaic Browser

At the time there were a number of different programs like 'fetch', 'gopher' and 'archie' that were used to download, browse and search for files.  Typically you might use one tool to search for the location of files of interest, then another to copy that file to a local machine.  Then you still needed more tools to read that file.  If it was text, you could use a text editor, if it was a formatted document you might need a word processor, if a picture you would need an image viewer and so on.

Marc Andreesen conceived of a solution that would put all the pieces together in one app, making it easy for users to browse all the different sorts of information and data on the World Wide Web.  Together with others, he started the "Mosaic" project.

Though not technically the first browser, Mosaic was the first one that many people experienced and played a big part in popularizing the concept of the World Wide Web and the Web Browser. It provided a simple graphical way to access and browse the various resources on the Internet. Instead of using different tools to download and view information on the internet, a simple click on a link would present the information in a graphical window. In many ways it is the ancestor of most modern browsers.

# Module 1: My first Web page   1.3 Elements, tags and attributes   Putting the "M" in HTML

# Putting the "M" in HTML

So the "M" in HTML stands for "Markup", but what does Markup really mean?  Essentially it means to annotate a document with extra information.  Things like where different sections and paragraphs begin and end, which part is the title, which things should be emphasized and so on.  

There are many ways to markup a document, but HTML borrows a technique from an ancestor language, SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language), which uses angle brackets ("<" and ">") to separate the annotations from the regular text.  In HTML these annotations are called "tags".

For example, consider the following chunk of HTML code:


```[html]
   <body>
      <h1>A Tale of Two Cities</h1>
      <p>
         It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, . . . .
      </p>
      . . .
      <p>
         . . . it is a far, far better rest
         that I go to than I have ever known.
      </p>
   </body>
 ```
   
If you eliminated everything in between the angle brackets from the text, for most purposes it would still read the same:

A Tale of Two Cities
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times . . . .
  . . .
. . . it is a far, far better rest
    that I go to than I have ever known.
Once you know that everything in angle brackets is "meta-information", it leaves a lot of flexibility. You can put a lot of different things in between those brackets without any of it showing up (directly) in your finished document. And, though you don't usually see directly what's in those angle brackets, they can often have a big effect on what your Web page looks like as well as how it responds and interacts with you.

Try It Out!

I expect at this point you may be itching to write some HTML code.  As is the tradition in programming tutorials, we'll pause here to create a simple "Hello World" program.

If you went through the preparation for this course, you should have Intel® XDK installed on your system, or you can choose any other editor of your liking.

Note: If you wish to share your HTML code in the discussions, you can paste your code directly in a discussion forum post (highlight code and Ctrl+K/use the code widget) or use one of the following online code editors:

JS Bin: http://jsbin.com (JS Bin tutorial)
CodePen: http://codepen.io (CodePen tutorial)
These are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code editors that preview/showcase your code bits in your browser. It helps with cross-device testing, real time remote pair programming.

Programming "Hello World"!

Open Intel® XDK and create a new project, using the "Blank" template, being sure to choose the "Standard HTML5" version (not Cordova). Click on "Continue" and choose a name for your project (like "hello-world"). Next you should see a "Success" dialog. Click on "OK" and you'll find yourself in Intel XDK's DEVELOP tab. This is where code is created and modified. In our case, we want to modify it so that it say's "Hello World" instead of "Hello Intel XDK".

The first thing you'll probably notice is an abundance of angle brackets ('<' and '>') and a bunch of stuff that looks unintelligible at first glance. This is mostly instructions and a basic template of code that most people will want in their project. For now, though, we're not worried about that, so on the first line that says "<head>" (line 6), there is a little triangle just to the left of "<head>". Click on that triangle to hide or un-hide all that code. Go ahead and hide that for now, it doesn't concern us yet.

Now you should see a line like "<p>Hello, Intel XDK!</p>". Highlight the "Intel XDK" names and type "World" in their place. Of course, it doesn't look much like a web page yet.

To see what it might look like on a laptop, tablet, or some other device, click on the SIMULATE tab  (previously Emulate). Choose the device and operating system you wish to simulate using the pull-down menus at the top-left of the screen. For this example, we'll use a Samsung device running Android:

Choosing simulated device

Press the Start Simulator or Preview button Preview icon to set things rolling (you may be asked to save the HTML file - it's a good idea!). You should see a mockup of a screen with the words "Hello World" on it, just as it would appear on a Samsung tablet, together with all sorts of other detail (NB I 'cheated' by increasing the size of the font, to make it easier for you to read - what a fine chap!):

Simulation

If you're really interested, you can try out different devices from the two menus mentioned earlier - you may have to Stop this run, and request another Preview.

Another way to see your work is to open the html file in a browser. If you navigate the file system to go to the folder for your project (that you set up when you created the project) and under there you'll see a "www" folder. Inside that, you should see a file called index.html. If you open that file with your favorite browser, you should again see a simple page with the text "Hello World!".

Finally, don't forget the method we used earlier: using the DEVELOP tab's Live Development Tasks panel (on the right-hand side) to establish a dynamic connection with your favorite browser.

IMPORTANT: since the video (below) was made, Intel have updated XDK. You might like to use the screen dumps from v3491 (as above) to supplement the video explanation.

# Module 1: My first Web page   1.3 Elements, tags and attributes   Elements

# Elements

If you are sitting at a coffee shop next to a table of Web developers, you will probably hear three words quite a bit:  'Tags', 'Attributes' and 'Elements' (or sometimes 'DOM elements', same thing just more precise and wordy).

'Elements' are the pieces themselves, i.e. a paragraph is an element, or a header is an element, even the body is an element.  Most elements can contain other elements, as the body element would contain header elements, paragraph elements, in fact pretty much all of the visible elements of the DOM.



Consider the figure above.  It contains a single 'html' element.  It turns out this includes within it the entire content of your html file.  If you click on the "html" node, you'll find that it contains two components, a head and a body.  Clicking on each of those will reveal their respective contents.  This structure is what we computer scientists call a "tree".  Any given element (except for the outermost 'html' element) is wholly contained inside another element, referred to as the "parent" element.  Not surprisingly, the elements that a given element contains are its "child" elements.  And, yes, children of a common parent are often referred to as "siblings".

Thus in the example above, the top element is the html element, which contains just two elements, the head and body.  The head element contains a title element and the body contains an 'h1' element and a 'p' element.  In a more typical example, the body would contain many more children, but for our purpose this is enough.

That may be a great picture, but how do we represent such a structure in a text file?  Well, that's where "tags" come in.

# Module 1: My first Web page   1.3 Elements, tags and attributes   Tags

# Tags

Thinking about HTML tags
```[html]
<html>
<body>

<p>

<em>
```

'Tags' are what we use to organize a text file (which is just a long string of characters) such that it represents a tree of elements that make up the html document.  Tags are not the elements themselves, rather they're the bits of text you use to tell the computer where an element begins and ends.  When you 'mark up' a document, you generally don't want those extra notes that are not really part of the text to be presented to the reader. HTML borrows a technique from another language, SGML, to provide an easy way for a computer to determine which parts are "MarkUp" and which parts are the content. By using '<' and '>' as a kind of parentheses, HTML can indicate the beginning and end of a tag, i.e. the presence of '<' tells the browser 'this next bit is markup, pay attention'.

What ever that tag (or 'open tag') does, it applies to the content following the tag. Unless you want that to be the entire rest of the document, you need to indicate when to stop using that tag and do something else, so '<' and '>' are again used. Since elements are typically nested within other elements, the browser needs to be able to distinguish between the end of the current tag or the beginning of a new tag (representing a nested element). This is done by adding a '/' right after the '<' to indicated that it's a 'close tag'. To indicate the beginning and end of a paragraph (indicated by the single letter 'p') you end up with something like this:

<p>This is my first paragraph!</p>
The browser sees the letters '<p>' and decides 'A new paragraph is starting, I'd better start a new line and maybe indent it'. Then when it sees '</p>' it knows that the paragraph it was working on is finished, so it should break the line there before going on to whatever is next.

For example, the '<em>' tag is used for element that needs Emphasis.  The  '<' and '>' indicate that this is a tag, and the "little bits of text" in between tell us what kind of tag it is.  To completely describe the element, it needs an open and close tag, with everything in between the tags is the contents of the element:

Diagram of an element

Most tags have open and close versions, but there are a few strange ones.  We'll learn more about these later, but we generally refer to the strange ones as "self closing" tags.   Usually these tags represent an element that is completely described by its attributes, and thus there is no need for other content.  So if you see something like this:
```[html]
<img src="https://goo.gl/pVxY0e" alt="Floating Flower"/>

```
... then you should know that the slash at the end of the open tag is sort of a shorthand for a close tag, so you won't see any other indication that this element is now complete.  There are also a few tags that don't even use the '/' at the end, they just don't have any close tag at all.  This works because all of the information this tag needs is declared in an "attribute".

# Module 1: My first Web page   1.3 Elements, tags and attributes   Comments

# Comments

Computers are great at reading computer languages, but it's not always easy for humans.  Comments are a way of adding some text that is primarily targeted towards human readers.

Every programming language I've used has some way of representing comments.  HTML5 is no exception.  If you want to add something in your file that you want the browser to completely ignore, there's a special tag for that (unsurprisingly called a "comment tag"):
```[html]
<!-- This is a comment -->
```

An HTML comment tag starts with '<!--' and ends with '-->', meaning that as the computer is reading through your HTML file, if it sees '<!--' it will ignore everything it sees until it comes across '-->'.  There is no open or close tag, just a comment tag.  Unlike most other things in HTML5, comments cannot be nested.  If you try that, like:
```[html]
<!--
Beginning of comment
  <!-- comment nested inside -->
This is after the nested comment
-->
```
Then the computer will see the beginning of the comment tag and start ignoring everything until it sees '-->', including the second '<!--'.  Once it sees '-->' it assumes the comment is done and goes back to processing everything it sees as HTML code and content, even though the writer may have meant it to be a comment.

Like most other tags, it can span multiple lines of your source file.  This can be really convenient when you have a lot to say:
```[html]
<!--
If you want some good advice,
Neither a borrower nor a lender be,
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
-->
```
Comments are also commonly used in development to block out bits of code, whether for testing or leaving unfinished business in the file:

```[html]
<!-- Not sure if I want this wording or not:
<p>Eighty seven years ago, a bunch of guys started a new country</p>
-->
```
It's important to remember that just as HTML, CSS and JavaScript are three different languages, they each have their own way of writing comments.  This might seem confusing, but it's actually kind of important that the HTML comments, at least, differ from the others.  As for the exact form of those comments, we'll cover that in good time.

# Module 1: My first Web page   1.3 Elements, tags and attributes   Attributes

# Attributes

Most of what we'll cover about attributes will come later, but I wanted to introduce the idea briefly. Basically, a given element on your webpage can be distinguished by any number of unique or common attributes.  You can identify it uniquely with an 'id' attribute, or group it with a class of other elements by setting the 'class' attribute.

Attributes in HTML are written inside the opening tag like this:
```[html]
<p id="paragraph-1" class="regular-paragraphs">
   Call me Ishmael . . .
 </p>
 ```
The paragraph above has a unique identifier, "paragraph-1" and is part of a class of "regular-paragraphs". The letters inside the quotes have no meaning to the computer, they just need to be consistent. They are actually strings, which as we will soon learn, if you want to have another paragraph in this class, it has to say "regular-paragraphs", not "regular" or "Regular-Paragraphs" or any other variation.

Again, the fact that the computer does not care what we put in those strings (except for some restrictions) means we can use them to convey meaning to a human developer. I could just as easily have said id='x' and class='y', but anyone looking at that would have no hint what the significance of x and y are. Best practice is to name these things to increase clarity, consistency and brevity.

But more about attributes in the next module.

# Module 1: My first Web page   1.3 Elements, tags and attributes   All together now

# All together now!

One key to understanding HTML, or any computer language, is to be sure that you avoid ambiguity, because computers generally are not good at judgement calls. For example, you could streamline HTML so that whenever you see a <p> tag, you start a new paragraph, no close tag needed. That might work most of the time, but that would prevent you from nesting one element inside another, as the computer could not know if you meant the new element to be nested or a successor.
A human designer might be able to tell what you meant from the context, and knowing that mistakes happen choose the one she thinks is best suited in that case. A computer, on the other hand, has difficulty with a task like that, so it is helpful to use a close tag that matches the open tag to make things absolutely clear.
<p>

down and looked over them about the

out under them.

and arrest his flight.

 The old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the room; then she put them up and looked out under them. There was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to seize a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight.
A human reader could easily detect that two paragraphs were intended and that the writer probably just forgot to terminate one and start the other. The computer, on the other hand, will only see one paragraph and layout accordingly.

On the other hand, you might think that since a computer always knows exactly what tag it is working with (eidetic memory), you could provide a sort of "universal close tag" that doesn't specify the type that it's closing. It would know to close the current tag. While that's technically true, it's handy to have the close tag there for people reading the code. It makes it easier to remember what tag it is closing. We humans can get confused trying to remember that kind of detail.

But there are other ambiguities to consider. For example, when a browser receives a file, it may know that it's receiving an HTML file, but it won't know which version of HTML is used (it matters).  That's why the first thing you need in any HTML file is a tag to tell you that what type of HTML file it is:
```[html]
<!DOCTYPE html>
```
In other words, the first thing the browser sees is the declaration "This is an HTML5 file, in case you were wondering". It may seem tedious to put this at the top of every file, but believe me, it used to be worse.  You probably noticed that it doesn't say "!DOCTYPE HTML5" but just "HTML". HTML5 can do this because all the previous versions were much more long winded.  For example, at the top of an HTML 4.01 page, you might have something like this:
```[html]
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
```
We do not need to go into the details of why and what that means, just be grateful that HTML5 did away with it.

Everything in HTML

It may seem redundant, but the next bit tells the computer where the actual HTML code begins, using an <html> tag:
```[html]
<html>
```

Nearly every HTML document has two parts. The 'body' is the main content of the page, containing text, images, tables and so on. The 'head' comes before the 'body' (on top?). It is where you put information about the document that does not really go in the body, AKA 'meta-' information. Things like what kind of character set is it using, where it can find style tips and what is the title of this page as the browser sees it (which might be different from the title the user reads) all go in the <head>. If you have been paying attention, you should be able to create a very basic html file, in the right form, without any content. Hint, for the head of the document you would write:
```[html]
<head>
 
</head>
```
You may recall the paragraph tag <p> that we used in the example above. Try inserting a paragraph into the body of your new document.  You should end up with something that looks like this:
```[html]
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   <head>
   </head>
   <body>
     <p>
       As my English teacher used to say, 'One sentence does not a paragraph make'!
     </p>
   </body>
</html>
```

# Module 1: My first Web page   1.4 Character encoding   Character encoding

# Character encoding

Character encoding world cloudA character can be any letter, digit or symbol that makes up words and languages. English alphabets and digits 'a-z', 'A-Z', '0-9' are all considered characters. Other examples of characters include the Latin letter á or the Chinese ideograph 請 or the Devanagari character ह. A character set is a collection of characters (letters and symbols) in a writing system.

Each character is assigned a particular number called a code point. These code points are stored in computer memory in the form of bytes (a unit of data in computer memory). In  technical terms, we say the character is encoded using one or more bytes. 

Basically, all the characters are stored in computer language and a character encoding is the awesome dictionary that is going to help us decode this computer language into something we can understand. In technical terms, it is what is used as a reference to map code points into bytes to store in computer memory; then when you use a character in your HTML, the bytes are then read back into code points using the character encoding as a reference. 

Examples of character encodings include:

ASCII: contains letters, characters and a limited set of symbols and punctuation for the English language
Windows-1252 (Latin1): Windows character set that supports 256 different code points
ISO-8859-6: contains letters and symbols based on the Arabic script
Unicode: contains characters for most living languages and scripts in the world
When you code in HTML, you must specify the encoding you wish  your page to use. Providing no encoding or the wrong one is pretty much like providing the wrong dictionary to decode. It can display your text incorrectly or cause your data to not be read correctly by a search engine. A character encoding declaration in your HTML is also important to process unfamiliar characters entered in forms by users, URLs generated by scripts, etc.

You should always use the Unicode character encoding UTF-8 for your web pages, and avoid 'legacy' encodings such as ASCII, Windows-1252 and ISO-8859-6 mentioned above. Do not use the UTF-16 Unicode encoding either.

It is important to note that it is not enough to simply declare your encoding at the top of the web page. You have to ensure that your editor saves the file in UTF-8 also. Most editors will do that these days, but you should check.

Read an Introduction to character sets and encodings here.

# Module 1: My first Web page   1.4 Character encoding   The meta tag

# Declaring the encoding of the page: the <meta> tag

You use the <meta> element with the charset attribute in your HTML page to indicate to the browser the character encoding you will be using in the page.
```[html]
<meta charset="utf-8">
```
Alternatively, you can also use http-equiv and content attributes. 
```[html]
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
```
We recommend using the first one because it is much less complicated. You should also always use 'utf-8'.

Where to place it?

The meta declaration belongs inside the <head> element, and should be specified within the first 1024 bytes of your page. So the earlier it is mentioned in your code, the better. 

W3C recommends placing it immediately after the opening <head> tag:
```[html]
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    ...
  </head>
</html>
```

Before we learn what HTML character references are, let's look at how the need for them came about. 

Try the following file in your HTML:
```[html]
<p>Welcome to the Introduction to HTML5. The first tag we will be learning about is  the <html> tag.</p>
```
Did you notice the <html> tag is missing in your output? In this case, your browser mixed it up with an actual tag, although it was meant to be a part of the sentence as text. 

Because of this kind of confusion, HTML reserves certain characters. If you want to use these characters in your HTML, you need to use character references to display them.

How to use character references

All HTML character references can be written using either a name or number. 

If you want to use a named character reference in your source code, use an ampersand symbol '&', followed by the name and a semi-colon. Names are case sensitive. For example, the following represents a no-break space:

&nbsp;

There are two types of numeric character reference: ones that use decimal numbers and ones that use hexadecimal numbers.  In each case, the number represents the code point number of the character in Unicode.

If you are using a decimal number, use an ampersand symbol '&' , followed by the symbol '#', then a decimal number and a semi-colon.

&#160;

If you are using a hexadecimal number, use an ampersand symbol '&' , followed by the symbols '#x', then a hexadecimal number and a semi-colon.

&#x00A0;

Protecting characters used for HTML syntax

The five special characters listed in the table below should always be written as character references if you want them to appear on your page when viewed by a reader:

Symbol	Entity Name	Entity Number	Usage
Less than '<'	&lt;	&#60;	
Div tag: &lt;div>

Greater than '>'	&gt;	&#62;	Div tag: &lt;div&gt;
Ampersand '&'	&amp;	&#38;	Tom &amp; Jerry
Non breaking space ' ' - space that will not create a new line	&nbsp;	&#160;	If you add multiple spaces, the browser will remove all but one. So you have to use this entity to add multiple spaces in your HTML page.
Quotes "	&quot;	&#34;	
Link to a another section on the same page using id of the element: &lt;a href=&quot;&num;timetable&quot;&gt;

Displayed as: <a href="#timetable">

&quot; is generally encouraged for code. For an actual quotation, <q> or <blockquote> is preferred. 

We do not want these special characters to be processed by the browser as HTML code. Instead, you want it to be displayed to the user. So if you wish to display this in your browser:
```[html]
<img src="images/test.png" alt="test image">
```
You have to write it like this in your HTML code:

&lt;img src=&quot;images/test.png&quot; alt=&quot;test image&quot;&gt;


Some tolerant browsers will allow using the '&' character directly but not all. So you should use its character reference &amp;. Check out these examples illustrating the importance of using the character entity &amp; for &.

While it might be tempting to not use one of these character references when you notice that the browser produces the expected result anyway, it is best practice to use character references for these five special characters using &lt;, &gt;, &quot;, &amp; and &nbsp; at all times.  This is because you can never be sure what browser or application will be used to view your code, and how that will behave.

The &quot; character reference is particularly useful for quotation marks within attribute values. Let's say you want to add a title attribute to an abbreviation to provide an expansion of the abbreviation. If you try the code below in a browser and hover your mouse pointer on the text 'HTML5', it will show you the title text (it works like a tooltip). The title text in the source code includes quotes (around the number 5) like this:
```[html]
<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language "5"">HTML5</abbr>
```
The above will not display the number 5.
Replacing the quotes with its character entity will work:
```[html]
<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language &quot;5&quot;">HTML5</abbr>
```

It is also possible to use character references to represent other characters in your page. This is useful when you are unable to type the character itself, or when you can't tell what the character is by looking at it (for example, a no-break space, or an invisible formatting character).

There are predefined, named character references in HTML for several categories, these include:

currency symbols
copyright, trademark and registered symbol
general punctuation
arrows
mathematical symbols
Greek letters

Any Unicode character can be represented using a numeric character reference.

Apart from the characters used for HTML syntax (described in the previous unit), there is usually no need to use character references to represent characters.  All browsers are built using Unicode internally, which means that they are capable of handling all possible characters defined by Unicode. So, the best practice for symbols like copyright, currency symbols, math and arrows is to simply type them directly into the source code.

You can do this directly in the code:   <p>This is © 2015. Breach will entail a fine of € 400</p>

 


There is no need for the &copy; or &euro; HTML character reference if you are able to type the character itself.
